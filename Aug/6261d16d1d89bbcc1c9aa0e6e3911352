FAM remains on the expansion course and increases its capacities by opening a new office in India, the seventh-largest country in the world in terms of surface area. The newly established subsidiary operating under the name of ‘FAM Materials Handling Systems India Pvt. Ltd.’ brings exciting challenges, new cultural features and a great potential for the project and service business. With this step, the FAM Group not only ensures close proximity to the customers of the numerous projects already implemented in South Asia, but also gains better access to new markets. In addition, the establishment of the FAM office in India facilitates the rise of the global prominence of the traditional German mechanical engineering company from Magdeburg and gives the entire FAM Group a boost in development through further internationalization and globalization. Headquartered in Magdeburg, Germany, the FAM Group has a total of 13 subsidiaries in Germany, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Canada, Russia, Singapore, Hungary, and Australia as well as representations, among others, in South Africa and in the United States. Approximately 1,500 employees work for the FAM Group around the globe. Planning, project development, designing, manufacturing, assembly and startup as well as servicing of bulk material conveyor systems generate a turnover of €300 million per year.
