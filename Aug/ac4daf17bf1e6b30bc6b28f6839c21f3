From 12 to 14 June, KVX provided product training to delegates from all over the world: Europe (Finland, Portugal, Norway, Poland, Russia, Belgium), America (Brazil, Peru), Oceania (Australia, New Caledonia) and South Africa. It was a pleasure for KVX to present its concepts, its product lines and their advantages by application. Participants were given hands-on training (using a torque tool and a spanner stand, how to measure buckets and handle the products) and they were invited to visit two KVX hardening facilities and a quarry with KVX systems in operation. The KVX members and their guests also enjoyed sharing socialization activities (boat trip in the fjord and hiking at the famous Pulpit Rock). The 2019 training was a success and KVX lookS forward to the next training in June 2020.
