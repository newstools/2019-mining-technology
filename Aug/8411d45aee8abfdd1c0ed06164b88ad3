Cascadia Scientific, a leader in fuel measurement and analytics, has been invited to speak at the Truck & Shovel convention taking place September 19th-20th in Singapore. Cascadia’s CEO, Kevin Dagenais will present ‘Using predictive modelling techniques to target mining inefficiencies’ focusing on Cascadia’s unique SmartRView platform. SmartRView- Cascadia’s flagship technology- leverages on-equipment fuel measurement to empower meaningful business improvement for mobile mining equipment. Cascadia is pioneering business improvement initiatives in the mining sector through direct fuel measurement and operational analytics. TRUCK AND SHOVEL- EVENT INFORMATION Truck and shovel mining today is anything but ‘conventional’. Most mines now utilise advanced fleet management systems (FMS) and data analytics to monitor their fleets in real-time – everything from payload to tyre conditions, engine performance and fuel management. The number of mines trialling or planning to trial fully autonomous machines or at least teleremote machines is increasing every single month as the benefits are proven and the hardware gets more affordable. The equipment OEMs themselves are planning for the future with cabless machines, machines running on LNG or electric power, and the use of geofencing, telematics and greater degrees of digitalisation. This conference will be the first load and haul event of its kind – one that is focussed on this topic but which has a firmly future mining emphasis. It is being held in the worldwide hub of Singapore, therefore tapping into the mining markets of Asia and Australasia and further afield, making it a truly global gathering.
