 Flexco recently announced the ‘Give Us Your Worst, We’ll Give You Our Best’ contest, inviting cement plants to send photos and videos of their biggest belt conveyor challenges for a chance to win free Flexco products and prizes. During the contest, which runs from 1 to 31 August, Flexco invites cement plant employees to record a video or snap a photo of problems along their beltline – mistracking, carryback, dust, spillage, slippage, etc. – and submit it online to enter the contest. All contest participants will be contacted by a Flexco Territory Manager, who will conduct a free assessment on the entire belt conveyor system, focusing on the ‘worst’ challenges and identifying any additional challenges they discover. The Flexco expert will offer solutions to these conveyor issues, and one cement plant will be the Grand Prize Winner of free product and delivery, free training, and a $250 product voucher towards future purchases. “At Flexco, we are always striving to learn more about the challenges our customers face every day, so we’re inviting them to tell us their stories with photos and videos,” Flexco Industry Manager Franklin Moore says. “And the grand prize winner will get a visit from Flexco experts that includes free product, free training, and most importantly, increased efficiency.” For more information on Flexco products, programs, and services, log onto the company website.
