 After our successful exhibition at Minex Mount Isa, EUROGOMMA is developing a number of products targeting the Australian market. Differently from other mining markets where the screen panel standard is 1in x 1in or 305mm x 305mm, several modular screen systems in Australia are based on the dimensions 305mm x 610mm. In this view, we are designing a range of screening products to fit into this standard and presenting our key products to the clientele in order to offer a technical advantage versus the locally available products. One of our key products are our polyurethane membrane screens. The elasticity of the screening surface is extremely helpful to avoid pegging and blanking and increases the efficiency of every screen where solid polyurethane panels were in operation before us.
