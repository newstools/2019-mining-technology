NMiTE (New Model in Technology and Engineering) the project to create the engineering university of the future, has announced three new appointments to its Board of Trustees; Martin Hitchin, Rowena Innocent and Richard Lindsay-Davies, which will come into effect on 1 July 2019. Commenting on the appointments, Chairman Dame Fiona Kendrick said: “The addition of these three industry leaders, all with strong engineering backgrounds, will be great support for delivering our vision for the world’s most distinctive and innovative engineering curriculum. Each will reinforce the role of employer leadership of this project, as well as contribute a range of individual commercial experiences. These appointments bring our Board to nine, giving us additional breadth and diversity as we move towards university status.” NMiTE CEO Elena Rodriguez-Falcon said: “Our objective is to revolutionise engineering education by combining the most successful ways to learn from around the world into a new, bold and inspiring approach. Learning is centred around students solving practical engineering challenges, including their commercial aspects too, so it is great that our growing board increasingly reflects this. It is particularly rewarding that we have been able to increase this breadth by welcoming leaders from local, national and international businesses.” The NMiTE Board already comprises Dame Fiona Kendrick, former Chair and Chief Executive of Nestlé UK & Ireland; Professor Sir Eric Thomas, former Vice Chancellor of the University of Bristol; Jon Gorringe, former Finance  Director at the University of Edinburgh; Karen Usher, Founder and Chairman of HR Consultancy, TPO Inc; Ian Falconer, Senior Consultant at Pinsent Masons; and Peter Scott, Director of the Institute of Advanced Study at the University of Warwick.
