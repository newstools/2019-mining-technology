The Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town is the largest hospital in the Western Cape and the second largest hospital in South Africa. High-masts are installed around the campus, providing general area lighting. Previously, these were fitted with 400W HPS floodlights, which emitted a yellow light due to the poor colour rendering. As part of a cost saving drive, the Department of Health decided to replace these floodlights with LED floodlights. An energy saving of 50% was achieved, by replacing the 400W HPS floodlights with 216W OMNIstar-midi floodlights. The OMNIstar-midi was the floodlight of choice due to its high colour rendering index, and due to its high local manufacturing content. The OMNIstar-midi is the smaller sized floodlight in BEKA Schréder’s OMNIstar family. The various optical solutions make it a very versatile floodlight, ensuring the correct lighting for the area to be illuminated. It is a cost-effective and efficient lighting solution to maximise energy and maintenance cost savings in high-power applications. In addition, because it has been locally designed and manufactured, it takes Africa’s harsh environments and conditions into account, thereby ensuring a long lifetime. BEKA Schréder locally develops and manufactures energy-efficient LED lighting products, designed and suitable for local conditions. We are very proud to be associated with the Tygerberg Hospital and the Department of Health in providing a successful floodlighting solution for this project.
