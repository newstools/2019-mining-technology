Forth Ports owns and manages eight commercial ports across the UK, including the Port of Rosyth which is strategically located for road and rail and provides an important connection with mainland Europe and the UK. The Port of Rosyth is currently in an exciting phase of development with a multimillion-pound investment to provide a dedicated agri-bulk facility for Cefetra. The new terminal and improved storage facilities will deliver increased annual throughput and storage capacity positioning Rosyth as the main agri-hub for Scotland. In developing this new agri-hub, the safety of staff and protection of the environment is paramount. Forth Ports chose a SAMSON Eco Hopper to receive dry bulk materials as it offers a high and reliable import capacity whilst minimising the escape of dust and it is equipped with a host of safety measures to ensure effective and safe performance. This new ecological hopper conforms to EC Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC and ATEX Directive 2014/34/EU. Internally the Eco Hopper is approved to ATEX zone 20, externally to zone 21 and 22.
