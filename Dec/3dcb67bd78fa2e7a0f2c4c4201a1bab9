 There is no screening application where Eurogomma can’t propose a customized solution. Fine screening is often problematic because productive efficiency is not matching with wear life of the screening media and vice-versa – until now. We propose flexible screen panels for flip-flow and vibrating screen applications made of different grades of polyurethane joined together so to offer high elasticity for better efficiency and excellent tensile strength for longer life. Starting from 150-micron aperture size and 1mm cloth thickness we can design every possible solution for your specific needs and your material characteristics.
