GlobalData’s influencer score is calculated by identifying and analysing the usage of industry keyphrases across Twitter and company websites, then identifying the users, both companies and individuals, who use these terms. This produces a longlist of potential influencers, which is then further sorted in a second stage of analysis, where the company’s algorithms balance the relevance of the keyphrases used, the network of the influencers using them, how the network responds to the keyphrases, and finally how the keyphrases are analysed and interpreted by the influencers. These steps determine the final score given to each influencer, which dictates the final ranking.
