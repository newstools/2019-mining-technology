Mining companies rely on several pieces of heavy machinery and equipment to keep their operations going. If this equipment fails or breaks down, it can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost profits due to downtime. The amount that a particular incident may cost will depend on a number of factors such as the type of equipment that has broken down, the size of the company and the number of machines that are no longer operational. However, a typical incident averages about $180,000. Downtime alone can result in a loss of around $3,000 per hour, so something as simple as a flat battery can be extremely costly for a mining company. To ensure consistently high efficiency and productivity, you need a long lasting mining battery.
