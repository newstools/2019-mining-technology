BEKA Schréder was approached by the Managing Director of Ermelo Toyota regarding the possibility of LED luminaires for their showroom. After assessing and measuring all areas of concern, BEKA Schréder’s applications department created lighting designs to determine which luminaire would best comply to the required lux levels, and at the same time be the most cost-efficient lighting solution. Due to previous bad experience with low-quality LED luminaires, the client was at first sceptical of another LED solution, and how long it would last. Therefore, the warranty of the product, and BEKA Schréder being in business for more than 40 years, were deciding factors considering their first experience. The product of choice was the LEDbay, a locally designed and manufactured LED high-bay luminaire. It is highly efficient and energy saving, and can be used for low-bay or high-bay applications. The various optical solutions that are available, make it suitable for a range of applications, such as factories, warehouses, retail areas, and service stations, to name a few. The added advantages of LED technology include a long product lifetime, low maintenance requirements, and flicker-free lighting. Another important benefit is the product’s standard five-year warranty, as BEKA Schréder stands by its high-quality performing product. BEKA Schréder, through their senior technical sales consultant, Heinrick le Roux, is proud to report that the client is very satisfied with this installation, so much so that they have placed an order for their other showroom at Pongola Toyota, continuing their relationship. BEKA Schréder locally develops and manufactures energy-efficient LED lighting products, designed and suitable for local conditions. We are very proud to be associated with Ermelo Toyota in providing a successful lighting solution for this project.
