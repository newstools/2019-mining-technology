 SUPERflexy is quite a new product in the field of flip-flop screens and France is historically affectionate to the German technology in this sense. The experience and technical competence of our French representative has demonstrated to the transalpine clients in that SUPERflexy has nothing to envy to longstanding screening technology. We have been commissioned a SUPERflexy screen – model 1.0 x 4.09/flat deck/bolt down – by a client in Normandy to classify clinker under 8mm. Our client has appreciated these important qualities of our technology: We are very happy of this first step in the French market and we are sure that Jérôme will bring new clients to appreciate the qualities of our SUPERflexy. Our compliments and congratulations Jérôme!
