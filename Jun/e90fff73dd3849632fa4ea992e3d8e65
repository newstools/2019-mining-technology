Tutis has appointed Heather Munro, to the Tutis Company Board as a non-executive director effective from 1 June 2019. Heather has decades of experience with training and compliance across both the mining industry and registered training organisations. Moreover, she was the founding business designer of the TUTIS software product and brings with her a deep understanding of the needs of the resources sector for an end-to-end solution to deliver workforce compliance assured. Heather has been the owner/manager of Registered Training Organisations and has 30+ years’ experience in training & safety compliance, consulting and product design in the resources industry across Queensland and Western Australia. “I am thrilled to have Heather join the Tutis board, she brings a wealth of training and compliance expertise and has deep knowledge of the markets in which Tutis operates” said Tutis Chairman, Simon Bird. This follows Heather’s decision to step-down from her executive role with Tutis as Vice-President Customer Success. Whilst she will be greatly missed as an executive it is excellent to retain her expertise via the board role. “I am delighted that Heather will continue to be active in the resources sector through her new role as CEO of the Resources Training Council (RTC) and wish her all the best in this role. I would also like to thank Heather for her very strong contribution over many years both as founder of the TUTIS product and more recently as a Tutis executive” said Tutis CEO, Chris Wright.
