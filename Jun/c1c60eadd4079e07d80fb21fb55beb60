EXAIRâ€™s new Hot Tap Digital Flowmeters allow installation when compressed air piping is under pressure. By eliminating the need to isolate and remove pressure from the pipe, these compressed air flowmeters reduce installation time while maintaining safety. Hot Tap Digital Flowmeters incorporate two valves that the measuring probes pass through. A sound muffler that also collects chips from the drilling process eliminates installation debris from entering the airstream and minimises noise exposure. Measuring compressed air is the first step toward identifying high compressed air use areas, compressed air leaks and optimising air use. Each meter ships with the necessary hardware and tools for installation, including drill bit, drill guide, chip capturing muffler, and hex wrenches. The Hot Tap feature is available on 2in (51mm) through 8in (203mm) flowmeters. They are available in standard units which display airflow values on a bright LED screen, with an optional data logger to capture and manipulate the data, or with wireless capability to transmit the data securely over a wireless network. Airflow values are expressed in Standard Cubic Feet per Minute or Cubic Meters per Hour. Hot Tap Digital Flowmeters for schedule 40 iron pipe and Type L Copper are now available in sizes 2in (51mm), 2.5in (64mm), 3in (76mm), 4in (102mm), 6in (152mm) and 8in (203mm). They are CE and RoHS compliant and can also be ordered for schedule 80 or 10S pipe.
