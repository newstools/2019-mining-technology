Backplane Systems Technology is excited to present the new POC-500 series of ultra-compact embedded computers with 4x PoE+, 4x USB 3.0, and MezIO™ interface. The POC-500 series models are a set of next-generation ultra-compact embedded controllers offering performances never before seen in this kind of form factor. Featuring an AMD Ryzen™ Embedded V1000 4-core/ 8-thread processor, the POC-500 delivers up to three times the CPU performance of prior POC-series models. As for GPU performance, it delivers a previously unheard of 3.6 TFLOPS in FP16 for an ultra-compact form factor embedded controller. Additionally, it manages to incorporate an M.2 2280 NVMe SSD to support four times the disk read/write speed of typical 2.5″ SATA SSDs. This new series continues the ingenious DIN-rail mounting mechanical design trend of previous POC-series models and offers a wealth of front-accessible I/O. Measuring just 63 x 176 x 116mm, it has 4x PoE+ ports, 4x USB 3.0 ports, and 4x COM ports. Best of all, all data ports come with a screw-lock mechanism so you can rest assured that cables are always secured. The POC-500 series models are available in two CPU variants: the V1807B (45W) variant is for high computing power demand, while the V1605B (15W) variant is designed for rugged fanless operation. The arrival of the POC-500 series signals a new breed of ultra-compact embedded controller with better I/O design, extraordinary ruggedness, and significantly more CPU/GPU oomph for versatile applications.
