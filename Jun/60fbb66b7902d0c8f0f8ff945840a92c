EXAIR’s new 30 Gallon Heavy-Duty HEPA Vac is a powerful, HEPA quality, industrial vacuum cleaner. This smaller volume drum means that it will fit in tighter spaces and is suited well for less frequent or lower volume applications. The Heavy Duty HEPA Vac is designed to move more material with less wear. It has been engineered to filter contaminants to HEPA requirements in dusty environments requiring frequent cleaning. It is extremely quiet at 82dBA (half the noise of electric vacs), making it suitable for a wide variety of environments. An economical, easily maintained pre-filter stops larger particles, while the HEPA filter handles the smaller matter. All filters are tested for minimum 99.97% filtration at the 0.3-micron level to meet HEPA standards in strict accordance to IEST-RP-CC-007. Available from Compressed Air Australia, EXAIR’s Industrial Housekeeping product line offers wet or dry vacuums from five gallons up to 44 gallons of capacity. They are available to outfit your existing drum or can be purchased with the complete drum assembly. Plastic or heavy-duty aluminium vacuum tools are available. All EXAIR vacuums are CE compliant and carry a five-year ‘Built to Last’ warranty.
