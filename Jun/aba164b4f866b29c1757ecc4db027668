ToxLogic Pty Ltd, trading as JK ProCare Systems, is a workplace drug and alcohol collection and testing service. The organisation is accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) to AS/NZS 4308: 2008 ‘Procedures for specimen collection and the detection and quantitation of drugs of abuse in urine’ (Section 2 and Appendix A) and AS 4760: 2006 ‘Procedures for specimen collection and the detection and quantitation of drugs in oral fluid’ (Section 2). NATA is the national accreditation body for Australia.  A NATA accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of our collection and testing services. All collectors employed or contracted by ToxLogic are required to successfully complete a recognised training course and receive a statement of attainment for the course in accordance with The Australian Quality Training Framework. ToxLogic Pty Ltd was established in 2013, encompassing the work of Occupational Toxicology Services Pty Ltd while retaining JK ProCare Systems as a trading name. Our head office is in Melbourne and we also operate a regional collection centre in Morwell. While most of our clients are based in Victoria, we offer an Australia-wide collection service where this is required by the client. Collections outside of Victoria are conducted either by ToxLogic staff travelling to the interstate site or by interstate contractors using ToxLogic equipment and procedures.
