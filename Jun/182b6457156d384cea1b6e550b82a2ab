In April, KVX introduced the new E2® M80 tooth system, mounted on the Komatsu PC1250-11 excavator at the Bauma exhibition in Munich. Following this success, KVX is launching an M80 System size promotional campaign. The KVX solution is special because the tooth system is bolted on the cutting edge (lip). This configuration is weld-free, which means less downtime and the possibility to freely switch between several KVX GET solutions. If a machine is moved from one application to another, you can easily adapt/change the GET system to a more optimal solution. If you change operators and they prefer a different configuration, you can easily adapt to their needs. KVX offers the opportunity to buy two unique GET systems at a great price to mount on your 90t-160t excavators: Thanks to its specific shape, the Heavy Duty (HD) lip will offer you a better penetration and will increase the lifetime of the teeth and therefore your service intervals. You can also mix the primary teeth with wear plates or ‘Milk teeth’ in between to have better lip protection and availability. The two systems were also displayed on the KVX booth. A lot of visitors and customers, especially in the quarry and mining industries, were really interested to see the details of KVX products. Customer testimonials The M80 1-bolt reversible tooth system has been used and appreciated by our customers all over the world for many years. KVX expects the same success with this new M80 E2® concept.
