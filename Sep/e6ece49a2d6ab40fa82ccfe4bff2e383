The definitions of a bully include tormentor intimidator, aggressor and tyrant. All these types are people who impose their will on others forcefully, or sometimes in more subtle ways that are not so easy to detect. The obvious loudmouthed bully or aggressor relies on seniority, power and position to bully juniors or staff members who are lower down the pecking order. They are usually managers or middle management, who rely on ordinary workers to make an impression on executive members, motivated by reward or promotion. Physical bullying can also present as sexual harassment which includes the more subtle psychological component, of the threat of job loss. The more subtle psychological bullying often appears as harassment, browbeating and even humiliation through teasing posing as harmless banter or ribbing. Do you have a bully in the workplace? Have you been ignoring this negative behaviour because the bully gets results? Have you been complicit because youâ€™re just too busy to bother? Have you noticed that workers are far more relaxed and productive on certain days? The next time you see this, check if the bully is at work. You could so easily get the same high production rate without the bullying. It may be time to do something to make a change.
