Efficient slurry pump performance is contingent upon regular pump maintenance – and that includes nose gap adjustments. The benefits of such adjustments and how GIW can make this easier will be the focal point of GIW’s exhibit at the Florida SME Regional Mining Conference, October 9 – 10 in Lakeland, Florida. Regular nose gap adjustments can double the wear life of pumps and reduce downtime, which means reduced operating costs. GIW makes this process easier with its’ Adjustable Suction Liner (ASL) technology. The ASL allows for nose gap adjustments on the fly and is a perfect fit for the WBC pump. Don’t just read about it, stop by our booth and let our team show you the ASL, how it works, and how easy it is to install and maintain. Stay connected, add us to your conference agenda.
