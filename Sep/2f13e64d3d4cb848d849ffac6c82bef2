 There is nothing that we love more than innovating. Every problem of our clients is a challenge that we want to win in order to bring something new and something better into the market. It is true that weir bars on screen panels help to keep the material on the screen deck but are they really effective? They create a sort of a damn but the 90Â° angle between the screening surface and the weir bar makes sand sit there creating a deposit locking the apertures. So, a screen panel becomes a blank panel in days or in hours. Our EURO PS screen panels with rounded weir bars avoid this problem because the rounded angle between the screening surface and the weir bar allows the constant flow of material and water. Besides the usage of the weir bar surface allows our Designers to increase the number of apertures with an average 15% open area improvement versus the standard models. Furthermore the rounded shape reduces also the wearing effect on the screening surface for a longer product life.
