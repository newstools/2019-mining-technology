EXAIR’s new 2.5in and 3in High-Temperature Line Vac Conveyors convert hose, tube, or pipe into a powerful in-line conveying system for high temperature materials up to 482ºC (900ºF). These air operated conveyors are available with smooth ends to fit into hose or tube and secured with a simple hose clamp, or they are available with NPT threaded ends to mount into threaded pipe. They feature large throat diameters for maximum throughput capability. Available from Compressed Air Australia, the High Temperature Line Vac Conveyors eject a small amount of compressed air to produce a vacuum on one end, resulting in high output flows on the other. The response is instantaneous. Regulating the compressed air pressure provides infinite control of the conveying rate. High Temperature Line Vacs are CE compliant and available in seven sizes from 3/4in (19mm) to 3in (76mm). Construction is durable Type 303 or Type 316 stainless steel to resist high temperature, corrosion and contamination. Applications include sampling hot flue gases, exhausting fumes, conveying soot, ashes, salts and other hot debris. Other models for hopper loading, scrap and trim removal, small part transfer and packaging are available.
