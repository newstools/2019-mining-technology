Backplane Systems Technology is bringing out the new Winmate’s Chassis Mount 4K UHD Military Display. This is a complete military-grade video wall solution engineered in 27”, 32” and 40” sizes and with 4K-UHD/HD options. This will aid users looking for a larger screen to display data and ultra-high resolution visual information solutions sufficiently, as well as minimise errors and improve operational efficiencies. The ergonomic panel design features a 0% – 100% LED dimmer and P-Cap technology. The military display has sunlight / night-time reliability and a multitouch experience. To optimise the use of physical space, each display is equipped with a true-flat and slim bezel. This supports various mounting solutions designed to suit different installation requirements, including flush rack, panel and VESA mount. Defence and inspection applications are a 24/7, 365-day mission, consequently, these video wall solutions feature true durability. The bezel consists of aluminium with anti-corrosion treatment. All devices are MIL-STD 810F/G and MIL-STD 461E/F compliant, meaning that they can withstand extreme environmental conditions such as high and low temperatures, shock, vibration or humidity while meeting the requirements for the control of electromagnetic interference. Protection from electromagnetic interference is further enhanced by the application of ITO EMI shielding. Winmate uses the MIL-DTL-38999/1 military-grade power connector to ensure reliable power and rugged mechanical performance. Key Features:
