Outotec has been awarded a contract to design and deliver a mine paste backfill system to OZ Minerals’ Prominent Hill mine. The contract price is €15 million and it has been booked into Outotec’s 2019 second quarter order intake. Outotec’s supply includes the design and delivery of a complete paste backfill system as well as detailed design of the underground distribution network and fill management systems. The new paste backfill plant will be based on a unique process design, which allows flexibility to use continuously produced fresh tailings or store filter cake to meet the future backfill needs of the underground mining operation. The new facility is expected to have a capacity of 215m³ per hour. “A reliable paste backfill system is critical to the whole mine and its operations. We are pleased to support our customer to improve their tailings management in a sustainable way,” says Kimmo Kontola, head of Outotec Minerals Processing business.
