Much like the strata of rock visible in a mine, modern mining communications rely on various technologies, introduced to improve the safety, efficiency, and productivity of mining operations. Ground-breaking new technologies will continue to emerge, but earlier technologies continue to perform the function they were intended for, and do not necessarily become obsolete; indeed most remain relevant and are maintained, advanced and upgraded by manufacturers. So, rather than the development of a single, ideal technology, the future of mining communications lies in the smart integration of multiple new, and existing tools and techniques, as Unified Critical Communications combines mining operation technologies into a network of networks. Tait has published a new white paper exploring this and more – No Point of Failure: Innovation and Convergence in Mining Communications In this paper, we discuss: For more information, fill out the enquiry form on this page.
