Tait Communications has released a white paper focusing on the resource extraction industry, and how companies are harnessing digital communications to address falling revenue and profits. Driven by today’s communications revolution, these companies are assessing their options for critical communications and how they can help grow their future business. For almost a decade, companies which made money out of digging for coal, iron ore, diamonds, gold and other commodities have tumbled from their position as $1.8tn market value leaders to investment losers, simply treading water to stay afloat. Over this time, demand dropped sharply, commodity prices slid, and investors withdrew while operating costs remained high. While pricing and demand remain outside the control of mining companies, the industrial problems they face present opportunities to reduce risk and take control of future business. The white paper summarises the challenges this industry faces, describes solutions that have already been implemented and validates the role that critical communications will play in the mines of the future.
