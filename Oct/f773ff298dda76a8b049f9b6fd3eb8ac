BEKA Schréder has proudly completed the first LED floodlight installation for a stadium in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Stade DIUR or Kolwezi Sports Stadium is located in Kolwezi, which is the capital city of Lualaba Province in the south of the DRC. This LED floodlight installation will become the benchmark technology and installation for the DRC. The OMNIstar-maxi was the preferred LED luminaire due to its superior performance and high energy savings when compared to floodlights with traditional light sources. The OMNIstar-maxi LED floodlight offers all the advantages of an LED solution: low energy consumption, improved visibility with a colour temperature close to daylight, limited maintenance, longer life, and instant switch on/off, enhancing the athletic environment and minimalizing light pollution for the surrounding population. The OMNIstar-maxi has been designed to provide an unrivalled combination of performance and flexibility for lighting areas where high lumen packages are needed while offering maximum savings in energy and maintenance costs with a short payback time. Due to the positive impact of the resultant lighting in the initial phase, the client is considering further upgrading their installation to be able to have television coverage of games.
