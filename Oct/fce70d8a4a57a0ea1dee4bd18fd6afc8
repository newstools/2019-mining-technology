Eurogomma has been making punched screen cloths for many years. The company has now started punching in Eurogomma Russia and is subsequently repurposing some of its warehouses. While tensioned rubber screens are already very diffused, Eurogomma has developed further improvements to the product. Hooks are typically a critical area in a tensioned screen as the material that flows in their area wears the metal down, compromising the general life of the product. Eurogommaâ€™s polyurethane hook protections have a longer wear life than the rubber cloth, preserving the general duration of the product. On the same principle, the central polyurethane protection bar helps the rubber panel to work efficiently for as long as possible.
